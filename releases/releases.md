# üêø Releases

## v0.6.2

#### Sun, Aug 6, 2023

Two bigger things in this release. The first is that we now have an initial AppImage based Linux build! So fire up your Ubuntu and try it out.

The second is that we have integrated our own basic SSH key based workflow. We had some auth issues due to a hundred ways people auth for Git stuff, so we've provided an option if you prefer to have us own it a bit more.

We generate a ed25519 SSH key for you and provide a simple way for you to add our key to your GitHub profile, which allows us to push and fetch for you without having to deal with that yourself. We will also first attempt to find a key you already use, but if it doesn't work, we have a nice backup.

## v0.6.0

#### Thu, Aug 3, 2023

Mostly bug fixes plus some UX improvments to help with more empty states. Creates an initial virtual branch that is based on whatever git branch you were on when you selected your base branch, which should be helpful from scratch. Improvements to the file watcher and refreshing code. Bunch of stuff like that.

## v0.5.0

#### Thu, July 24, 2023

Well, the wait has been long, but we're back in the swing of things. We came up with a smashing new idea for how to do branches in a way nobody has ever done before and it took us a while to get it all working.&#x20;

This is a massive new feature and one you can check out in great detail in [our docs](../features/virtual-branches/).

For now, we've turned off access to the rest of the UI while we concentrate on getting this working, but boy is it cool. We'll get the timeline back in an even bigger and better way soon, but for now, please enjoy the best new way to work since hand tools.

## v0.4.0

#### Thu, May 25, 2023

Hot on the heels of our last release, we're introducing a new "bookmarking" feature. Now you can let GitButler know about important moments in your timelines that you might want to remember or go back to.

You can either create bookmarks by hitting the little bookmark button in the bottom right corner in the timeline, or you can hit Cmd-K to bring up the palette and create a new bookmark from there, wherever you happen to be in the timeline.

## v0.3.0

#### Monday, May 22, 2023

With this new release, you can now link a project on multiple computers to sync the working directory history of both of them. You can't quite actually check out those working directory states from one into the other, but it's a step closer.

Another nice addition is the feedback icon (little envelope looking thing at the bottom) that you can click at any time to share feedback with us or send us your logs/data in case there was an issue so that we can recreate and debug it.

There were also a number of speed increases and some more behind the scenes data structure changes, but don't worry about those.

## v0.2.1

#### Friday, April 28, 2023

Bug fixes and minor improvements.

## v0.2.0

#### Friday, April 21, 2023

New layout for the project page and redesign of the activity graphs in preparation for presenting more Git data in the sidebar. Also added some new styling to the commit page and have changed how we store our snapshot data so that it doesn't pollute the Git project space.

## v0.0.24

#### Tue, April 11, 2023

Fixed the terminal :joy:

## v0.0.23

#### Thu, April 6, 2023

This update ships with a new command palette for (better) fast access to all your GitButler needs, as well as an integrated Terminal per project.

You can also see your git status as you go without having to run `git status` all the time.

The terminal is mostly to iron out the bugs. Next up will be recording anything you do in your project terminal along with your file history for even more historical project context.

## v0.0.21

#### Fri, Mar 31, 2023

It's AI time! Now it is possible to have GitButler write your commit message via gpt4, including a description of what changes you've made to your code. Make commit messages like a kernel hacker, finally!

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2023-04-05 at 13.54.44@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We've also made improvements to the speed and performance of various pages and some interface polish.

## v0.0.20

#### Thu, Mar 23, 2023

This release adds a lot of speed and resource usage improvements, as well as our first real Git feature, the commit dialog.

Now you can go into commit mode, view the diff of any of the modified files you have, select which files to include or exclude from the commit and even ask our AI to look at the diff and come up with a commit message for you.

We're also releasing builds for Apple Intel chips in addition to the Silicon builds.

#### Thu Mar 16, 2023

This version adds a new and improved player view to see the history of your file changes.

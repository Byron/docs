# ðŸ¤µâ™‚ Welcome to GitButler

## Overview

GitButler is a new Source Code Management system designed to manage your branches, record and backup your work, be your Git client, help with your code and much more. Our focus is everything after writing code in your editor and before sharing it on GitHub. We're focused on your working directory and how we can help with everything you do there.

Here you will find documentation on the product and the way that we're running our beta and building our product with your help.

## What We Do

Currently GitButler does two things. It records everything in a working directory that you have so that you can rewind to any point in time for any file you have. It also does a growing set of Git operations, soon to be a full fledged Git client. You can read more about these features here:

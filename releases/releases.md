You can also see your git status as you go without having to run `git status` all the time.&#x20;

The terminal is mostly to iron out the bugs. Next up will be recording anything you do in your project terminal along with your file history for even more historical project context.



## v0.0.21

#### Fri, Mar 31, 2023

It's AI time! Now it is possible to have GitButler write your commit message via gpt4, including a description of what changes you've made to your code. Make commit messages like a kernel hacker, finally!

We've also made improvements to the speed and performance of various pages and some interface polish.

## v0.0.20

#### Thu, Mar 23, 2023

This release adds a lot of speed and resource usage improvements, as well as our first real Git feature, the commit dialog.

Now you can go into commit mode, view the diff of any of the modified files you have, select which files to include or exclude from the commit and even ask our AI to look at the diff and come up with a commit message for you.

We're also releasing builds for Apple Intel chips in addition to the Silicon builds.

# ðŸ’„ Committer Mark

We would like to make sure that GitButler can be free to use for everyone, but there are costs involved in hosting any synchronized client data, AI tooling and so forth. What we thought would be an interesting compromise is to ask our users to offset that by supporting us and our unique approach to that is to ask you to allow us to credit ourselves with commits you have made as your "committer".

### The Committer

Git actually natively supports having two individuals credited with any commit. The important one is the "author", which is normally the person who writes the code.

The other credit can optionally go to a "committer", which was historically the person who pulled the work into the project. Normally this is an open source maintainer or something, it's normally written when a branch is rebased or a commit is cherry picked.

By default, GitButler will credit itself as the "committer" on any virtual branch commits that you make. This helps us spread the word in a fairly non-intrusive way. You don't see the committer when you run `git log` normally, you only really see it on GitHub as a little icon behind the author's icon, like this:

Now, we realize that not everyone will want this, so there are **two ways** to turn off this functionality.

Being a supporter also comes with other fun benefits, but this is the only feature based one.

### Engage in the Community

There is another really easy way to toggle these off, but we ask that you ask us. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/MmFkmaJ42D), submit a bug or a feature request and we'll tell you the secret setting. :secret:
